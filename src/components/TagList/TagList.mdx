# Tag List Component

The **Tag List** component was developed to list an undetermined number of items inside its container. These internal elements are called **Tags** and receive **children** parameter in a **string** format. The component could be built using a parameter as an array, but to set the component more readable, it was decided to build a compound component. The implementation is very simple, where a **TagList** container is set, and for any new internal item, add a component called **Tag**.

## Implementation

This component has a very simple implementation. Just inform a **Tag** subcomponent as children.

<Controls of={TagListStories.Implementation} />

## Multiple Lines

Here it's possible to test the multiple lines inside the component to check its margin.

<Canvas of={TagListStories.MultipleLines} />
