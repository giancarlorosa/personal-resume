# Main Title Component

The **Main Title** component was developed to serve the `H1` tag for the pages. Its implementation is very simple and just asks for a **string** as parameter. Instead of using **props**, it was decided that using **children** could be more semantic and readable. As this component will always be te first element of any page, its alignm will be centered and it wil have a small underline element below the tag.

## Implementation

This component has a very simple implementation. Just inform a **string** as children.
**DO NOT USE NODE INSIDE CHILDREN PROP!**
