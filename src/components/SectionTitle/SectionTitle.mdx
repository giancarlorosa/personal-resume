# Section Title Component

The **Section Title** component was developed to serve the `H2` tag helping to name different sections of the page. Its implementation is very simple and just asks for a **string** as a parameter. Instead of using **props**, it was decided that using **children** could be more semantic and readable. The component receives a parameter called **fullWidth** that makes its underline element **100% width** of its container.

## Implementation

This component has a very simple implementation. Just inform a **string** as children.
**DO NOT USE NODE INSIDE CHILDREN PROP!**

If you want a **100% width**, just set the **fullWidth** parameter.

## Multiple Lines

Here it's possible to test the multiple lines inside the component to check its line height.

## Followed by a paragraph

Here it's possible to check the component margin bottom when it's followed by another element. The component container has a limited width to be possible to see multiple lines inside the container.
