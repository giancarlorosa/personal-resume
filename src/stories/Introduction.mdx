# Welcome to my personal resume project

This is a personal project from the creator **Giancarlo Rosa** to be used as a resume to apply for job positions. Initially, the idea is to be a focused document for Drupal job positions and some front-end job positions too, but in the future, this resume will have the responsibility to apply to any position that the creator has knowledge about.

Although the project is aimed at Drupal technology, it was built using React with Next framework. This choice was made in order to practice the gained knowledge about the tech. With this project, it was possible to practice React components creation, state management, tailwindcss, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

Even though it's a one-person project, the creator decided to implement Storybook with Chromatic and Codecov to check test coverage to practice these integrations and know more about how to manage a CI/CD. The creator decided to add Conventional Commits to experiment and test this convention.

As this is an open project, feel free to check my integrations and see how the work is being done. Any suggestions will be more than welcome!
